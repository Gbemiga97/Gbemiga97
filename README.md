## Hey there, future colleagues! 👋  
### I’m **Holuwagbemiga** — Your Friendly Neighborhood Junior IAM Admin

I’m at the start of my Identity & Access Management journey and **completely obsessed** with Microsoft Entra ID. Every day I’m learning how real-world identity security works, breaking (and fixing!) things in my home lab, and helping keep users safe.

I may be early in my career, but I’m fully committed to modern identity!

### What I’m Doing Right Now
- Managing day-to-day Entra ID tasks (user provisioning, group management, basic Conditional Access)
- Supporting **MFA rollout**, **passwordless** projects, and **self-service password reset**
- Helping teammates with **license assignments**, **app registrations**, and **service principals**
- Learning **Microsoft Graph API** and **PowerShell** to automate repetitive tasks
- Studying for the **SC-300: Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator** exam
- Building & breaking Conditional Access policies in my personal tenant (safely!)
